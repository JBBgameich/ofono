# This is a sample file for the static modem configuration
#
# It should be installed in your oFono system directory,
# e.g. /etc/ofono/modem.conf
#
# Each group is parsed as a modem device
# Each group shall contain the following keys:
# Driver = <driver string>, e.g. generic_at, phonesim, mbm, g1
# Type = tcp | unix | tty
# InitString = <init string to send to device>, e.g. ATZ
#
# If Type is tcp, the following keys are available:
# Address = <valid IPv4 address format>
#
# If Type is unix:
# Address = UNIX path, prefixed by x00 for anonymous paths
#
# If Type is tty:
# Device = <device path>

# Sample for using phone simulator
#[phonesim]
#Driver=phonesim
#Address=127.0.0.1
#Port=12345

#Sample for OpenMoko calypso
#[calypso]
#Driver=generic_at
#Type=tty
#Device=/dev/ttySAC0
#InitString=AT+CFUN=1
#TimeoutCommand=\r
#TimeoutInterval=5

#Sample for Android/HTC G1
#[g1]
#Driver=g1
#Device=/dev/smd0
