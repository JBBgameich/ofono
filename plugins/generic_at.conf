# This is a sample configuration file for the generic_at plugin
# It should be installed in your ofono sysconfdir, e.g.
# /etc/ofono/generic_at.conf
# Each group is parsed as a device
# Each group can contain the following keys:
# Type = tcp | unix | tty
# InitString = <init string to send to device>, e.g. ATZ
#
# If Type is tcp, the following keys are available:
# Address = <valid IPv4 address format>
#
# If Type is unix:
# Address = UNIX path, prefixed by x00 for anonymous paths
#
# If Type is tty:
# Device = <device path>

#[phonesim]
#Type=tcp
#Address=127.0.0.1
#Port=12345

#Sample TTY for OpenMoko calypso
