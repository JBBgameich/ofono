rilmodem
********

This git repository is a temporary fork of ofono 1.12 meant as a staging
area for work on rilmodem, an ofono driver and associated plugins used 
to provide a telephony stack based upon an Android RILD instance ( vs. a
native modem driver ).

It's the intention of the developers of this code to work with the
ofono developers to eventually upstream this code, however as there is
still work to be done ( missing core features, code cleanup, unit tests,
... ), this repository has been created to make cross-distro colloboration
on rilmodem easier.
